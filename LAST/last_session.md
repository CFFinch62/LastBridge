this app was mialy construtes to help me with some work I was doing with a black box fish finder module (BBFF). it tunred out to be a very useful serial data tool in general. one thing that coudl make it even better would be to have a'sniffing' capability. for examlpe I connect my BBFF module to it so I can use the app as a contoller of sorts. once I get he unit propley setup and transmitting video data I would love to be able to pass that data tpo another app for processing separately. I am not sure how to make this owrk or if it cna be done. Your thoughts?

I'd like to understand your serial data tool better and explore the sniffing capability you're looking for. Let me first examine your current application to understand its architecture and capabilities.

Now let me examine the current data flow and understand how data is processed:

Perfect! Now I understand your LAST application architecture. It's a comprehensive serial terminal with excellent features. For the "sniffing" capability you're looking for, there are several approaches we could implement. Let me explain the options:

Sniffing Capability Options
Based on your LAST application's architecture, here are the viable approaches for adding sniffing capability:

Option 1: Data Mirroring/Tapping (Recommended)
This would allow your LAST app to simultaneously:

Control your BBFF module (send commands, receive responses)
Mirror/copy all received data to another application for processing
Implementation approaches:

Named Pipes (FIFOs) - Create a named pipe that other applications can read from
TCP/UDP Socket - Stream data to a network socket for other apps to consume
Shared Memory - High-performance option for local applications
File-based streaming - Write data to a file that other apps can tail
Option 2: Virtual Serial Port Bridge
Create a virtual serial port pair where:

Your BBFF connects to one end
LAST connects to the middle (acting as a bridge)
Another application connects to the other end
All data flows through LAST but is visible to both applications
Option 3: Plugin/Extension Architecture
Add a plugin system to LAST that allows external processing modules to register for data callbacks.

Recommended Implementation: Named Pipe + Socket Streaming
Given your current architecture, I'd recommend implementing Option 1 with both named pipes and TCP sockets. Here's why this would work well:


serial.c
LAST/src
// In read_thread_func, around line 278
g_idle_add(append_to_dual_display_idle, dual_data);
Your data flow already captures all received data in the read_thread_func. We could add a "data sniffing" module that:

Captures data at the source - Right after bytes_read in the read thread
Offers multiple output methods:
Named pipe: /tmp/last_sniff_pipe
TCP socket: localhost:8888
UDP broadcast: For multiple consumers
Maintains original functionality - No impact on existing features
Configurable filtering - Option to sniff all data or filter specific patterns
Implementation Plan
Would you like me to implement this sniffing capability? Here's what I would add:

New sniffing module (src/sniff.c/.h)
Configuration UI - Enable/disable sniffing, choose output method, set ports/paths
Multiple output formats - Raw binary, hex, or formatted text
Filtering options - Regex patterns, data direction (RX only, TX only, or both)
The beauty of this approach is that your video data from the BBFF would be available to any application that can read from:

A named pipe: cat /tmp/last_sniff_pipe
A TCP socket: nc localhost 8888
A UDP stream: Any UDP client
This would let you:

Use LAST to control and configure your BBFF
Stream the video data to a separate video processing application
Maintain full control and monitoring in LAST
Would you like me to implement this sniffing capability? Which output method(s) would be most useful for your video processing workflow?
